### Equipment

- 20cm diameter springform or silicone cake tin
- baking paper
- tin foil
- roasting tray, ideally pyrex as it's inert to the oxalic acid from the rhubarb
- optional but helpful, dredging spoon
- optional but really helpful, large metal serving spoon
- two large mixing bowls
- two additional containers, one suitable for four eggs to be beaten in and the other to hold less than 500ml of dry ingredients
- a coffee or food grinder that you are willing to put almonds in, or buy the almonds pre-ground

### Ingredients

* 600 g fresh rhubarb, in 2cm chunks
* 100 g demerara sugar
* 3 tsp ground ginger
* 1/2 juiced_fruit lemon juice
* 250 g unsalted butter
* 160 g self-raising flour
* 100 g oats, ideally jumbo
* 4 count medium eggs, beaten
* 100 g almonds, ground
* 1 pinch salt

### Directions

Preheat the oven to gas mark 5 (200&deg;C). Line the cake tin with baking paper.

This cake is made in four stages: A) roast the rhubarb, B) make the streusel, C) make the cake batter, and D) layer the products of A-C into the cake tin for baking.

#### A: Roast the rhubarb

1. Spread the rhubarb evenly across the roasting dish.
2. Splash the lemon juice evenly across the rhubarb.
3. Mix 40g demerara sugar with 1 tsp ground ginger in the dry ingredients container and use the dredging spoon (or dessert spoon) to scatter the sugar-ginger mix across the rhubarb evenly. Retain the dry ingredients container for later use.
4. Roast the rhubarb for 15 minutes until soft.
5. Set the rhubarb aside and turn the oven down to gas mark 3 (170-&deg;C).

#### B: Make the streusel

1. In one mixing bowl, rub 200g butter into 60g flour and the oats until it turns into small crumby lumps.
2. Stir in the remaining 60g demerara sugar and set the mixing bowl aside.

#### C: Make the cake batter

1. In the second mixing bowl, cream the remaining 200g butter and caster sugar together until the mixture is homogenous. I used a fork because I don't have an appropriate electric mixing tool.
2. Add the beaten egg a little at a time, stirring well and beating the mixture to get air into it once all the egg is added. I used a fork for this.
3. Fold in the remaining 100g flour, remaining 2tsp ginger, ground almonds, and salt until the mixture is homogenous. I used a large metal serving spoon for this, if you only have a dessert spoon you can use that but it will be harder to grip.

#### D: Filling the cake tin

1. Drain the rhubarb using a colander.
2. Use the metal spoon you mixed the batter with to spread half of the batter evenly across the bottom of the cake tin.
3. Scatter half of the streusel evenly into the cake tin.
4. Scatter half of the rhubarb evenly into the cake tin.
5. Spread the remaining batter on top of the layers in the cake tin and smooth it.
6. Scatter most of the remaining streusel into the cake tin.
7. Scatter the remaining rhubarb into the cake tin.
8. Scatter the last of the streusel into the cake tin.
9. Put the cake tin in the oven for one hour.
10. Cover the cake tin with foil and return to the oven for one hour.
