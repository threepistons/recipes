# Recipes

This recipe collection is designed to work with [KookBook](https://github.com/KDE/kookbook) but is also legible in Github or any MarkDown interpreter.

I have assumed that you have the equipment listed at [Units and assumptions > Assumptions > Equipment](units-assumptions.recipe.md#equipment).
