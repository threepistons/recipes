# Chorizo and manouri salad

Serves 1.

I grow lettuces because I find that garden-grown lettuce is much less bitter than lettuce from the shop.  One of my Black-seeded Simpson lettuces "bolted", that is, started to make a flowering spike, so I had to harvest it early.  Tip: when preparing a lettuce in the early stages of bolting, the leaves near to the top may be too bitter to eat, so test them before you make a dish with them.

My dash to Lidl for food I could use with the lettuce was during a Greek-themed Special Buy and I impulsively bought a type of cheese I'd never seen before, called manouri.  Other than the lettuce, everything listed was from Lidl.

The mild Black-seeded Simpson lettuce combines well with the creamy manouri.  Feta would be too acid and overpower the lettuce, and rocket leaves would overpower the manouri.

### Ingredients

 * 1 plateful lettuce, washed and ripped up
 * 50 g manouri, diced.  Use softish white goat cheese if you can't get manouri.
 * 8 count tiny plum tomatoes, washed and intact
 * 5 cm chorizo, dicedish
 * 6 dollops caramelised onion houmous
 * 6 dollops potato salad
 * 1 shake french salad dressing

### Directions

1. Heap the lettuce on the plate, leaving a margin around the edge of the plate.  When you think you have enough lettuce, add some more as it goes flat when you put the other ingredients on.
2. Arrange the manouri, tomatoes, and chorizo on top of the lettuce as if you were arranging toppings on a pizza.
3. Add the dollops of potato salad to the margin of the plate at equal distances, i.e. if the plate was a clock, the dollops would cover the even numbers.
4. Add the dollops of houmous to the margin of the plate between the potato salad.  If the plate was a clock, the houmous dollops would cover the odd numbers.
5. Shake some french salad dressing over the leafy areas of the plate.
