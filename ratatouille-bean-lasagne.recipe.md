# Ratatouille and bean salad lasagne

This came about during COVID-19 self-isolation when I had no fresh food left.  All the ingredients can be bought vegan and gluten-free.

Prep time 15m, cook time about 60m, could have been less if I'd boiled the pasta first.

### Equipment

- Rectangular roasting dish that's about 5cm deep, mine's 25cm by 30cm and made of pyrex.

### Ingredients

* 2 tins tinned ratatouille
* 2 tins mixed bean salad
* 1 packet lasagne sheets
* 1 tsp vegetable oil

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to gas 7.
2. Select enough lasagne sheets to cover your dish twice.  Gaps are allowed.  Blanche the lasagne sheets in hot water or pre-cook according to the instructions on the packet.
3. Drain the bean salad.
4. Grease the dish with the oil.  If you don't do this, the first layer of lasagne will become welded to the dish.
5. Cover the bottom of the dish with half the lasagne sheets.
6. Layer the beans on top of the lasagne sheets.
7. Add the second layer of lasagne sheets on top of the beans.
8. Layer the ratatouille on top of the second lasagne sheets.
9. Cover the dish with foil and place in the oven.
