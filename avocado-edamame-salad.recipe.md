# Avocado and edamame salad

Serves 2.

The frozen edamame (a small type of soya bean) have a bright green colour that dried soya beans don't have, which makes the salad look more appetising. Larger soya beans can be used if you can't get edamame, as long as they are frozen. If you use dried beans, you will need to find out yourself how to soak and cook them and they will be more yellowish.

### Ingredients

 * 160 g spinach, fresh and washed
 * 160 g edamame beans, frozen
 * 1 count avocado
 * 1 bottle tamari soy sauce, to add to taste #TODO record volume used next time I make this 

### Directions

1. Boil the edamame beans for two minutes from frozen.
2. Whilst you wait for the beans, stone, peel, and dice the avocado.
3. Empty the pan of beans into a colander and wash the beans in cold water to cool them.
4. Toss the beans, spinach, and avocado together.
5. Splash with tamari soy sauce.
