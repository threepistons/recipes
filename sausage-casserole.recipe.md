# Sausage casserole

This is my go-to casserole, serves six people.  It refrigerates well once it's cooled and one portion takes around four minutes to reheat in the microwave.  You need a lidded casserole dish of around five litre capacity, access to a hob, and access to a gas or electric oven.

Prep time 20m, cook time 2-4 hours depending on how hot you set your oven.

### Ingredients

* 1 clove garlic, or equivalent in garlic paste
* 3 tins tinned plum tomatoes
* 1 tin tinned butterbeans, or another white bean
* 1 tin tinned black eyed beans, or another dark bean
* 500 g carrots, skin left on
* 600 g potatoes, skin left on
* 1 whole red onion
* 1 unit stock cube/jelly, *not* made up with water
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 12 unit sausages
 
### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to gas 4-7.  At gas 7, you need to remove the casserole after two hours, at gas 4, remove after four hours.
2. Drain the beans.
3. Add the oil to the casserole dish base and set the casserole dish on the cold hob.
4. Crush the garlic and coarsely chop the onion and add them to the casserole dish.
5. Turn the hob on and start softening the onions.
6. When the onions are soft, add the plum tomatoes, beans, and stock cube/jelly.  Stir throughly to mix and turn the hob down.
7. Chop the carrots into 2cm wide roundels and spread them in a layer on the top of the tomato and bean mix.  Do *not* stir in.  If there are gaps in the layer, chop more carrots and add them.
8. Chop the potatoes into chunk a little smaller than you might use for a "roastie" but certainly bigger than dauphinoise, and spread them in a layer on top of the carrots.  If there are gaps in the layer, chop and add more potatoes.
9. Arrange the sausages on top of the potatoes, trying to have a bit of space around each one.
10. Put the lid on the casserole dish and transfer it to the oven.
11. If your casserole dish is thin-walled stainless steel, remove the lid 30 minutes before the end of the cooking.  Users of heavy cast iron pots need not do this because your lid will radiate sufficient heat to brown the sausages.
