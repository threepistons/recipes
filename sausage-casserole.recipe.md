# Sausage casserole

This is my go-to casserole, serves six people.  It refrigerates well once it's cooled and one portion takes around four minutes to reheat in the microwave.  It can be made gluten-free if you choose your sausages and stock carefully.

Prep time 20m, cook time 2-4 hours depending on how hot you set your oven.

### Equipment

* A lidded hob-safe casserole dish of around five litre capacity.

### Ingredients

* 1 clove garlic, or equivalent in garlic paste
* 3 tins tinned plum tomatoes
* 2 tins tinned mixed beans, or one tin dark beans (e.g. kidney) and one tin light beans (e.g. butter beans). See [Tips and gotchas > tinned beans](tips-gotchas.recipe.md#tinned-beans)
* 500 g carrots, skin left on
* 600 g potatoes, skin left on
* 1 whole onion
* 1 count stock cube/jelly, *not* made up with water
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil
* 12 count sausages

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to gas 4-7. At gas 7, you need to remove the casserole after two hours, at gas 4, remove after four hours.
2. Drain the beans.
3. Add the oil to the casserole dish base and set the casserole dish on the cold hob.
4. Crush the garlic and coarsely chop the onion and add them to the casserole dish.
5. Turn the hob on and start softening the onions.
6. When the onions are soft, add the plum tomatoes, beans, and stock cube/jelly. Stir throughly to mix and turn the hob down.
7. Chop the carrots into 2cm wide slices and spread them in a layer on the top of the tomato and bean mix. Do *not* stir in. If there are gaps in the layer, chop more carrots and add them.
8. Chop the potatoes into chunks a little smaller than you might use for a "roastie" but certainly bigger than dauphinoise, and spread them in a layer on top of the carrots. If there are gaps in the layer, chop and add more potatoes.
9. Arrange the sausages on top of the potatoes, trying to have a bit of space around each one.
10. Put the lid on the casserole dish and transfer it to the oven.
11. If your casserole dish is thin-walled stainless steel, remove the lid 30 minutes before the end of the cooking.  Users of heavy cast iron pots need not do this because your lid will radiate sufficient heat to brown the sausages.
