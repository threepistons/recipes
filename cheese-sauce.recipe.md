# Cheese sauce

Adapted from https://www.dovesfarm.co.uk/recipes/gluten-free-cheese-sauce

This is a dish component, you don't eat it on its own but use it as part of something else. Typical use cases include:
 * acting as the milk sauce layer in a lasagne;
 * pouring over cauliflower or pasta to make cauliflower or macaroni cheese;
 * when made with blue stilton, served as the "blue cheese sauce" with a steak.
 
The amount below makes enough cheese sauce for three-to-four people to have macaroni cheese.

### Ingredients

 * 600 ml milk, divided into 70-100 ml and 500-530 ml allotments
 * 200-300 g cheese, grated before you start. I suggest a mature coloured cheddar for most purposes, the colour makes it easier to see when the sauce is uniform.
 * 5 tbsp corn flour
 * 1 tsp mustard powder, optional
 * 1 tbsp worcester sauce, optional
 * salt and pepper

### Directions

1. Mix the corn flour with the mustard, if you are using the mustard.
2. Slowly add the 70-100 ml allotment of milk to the corn flour whilst stirring, until the mixture is uniform and lump-free.
3. Heat the 500+ml allotment of milk in a saucepan until almost boiling. Remove pan from heat.
4. Slowly add the corn flour mixture into the hot milk, stirring continuously.
5. Return the pan to the heat and stir continuously whilst the sauce thickens.
6. Stir in the cheese until the sauce is uniform in appearance, and add salt and pepper and, if desired, worcester sauce.
