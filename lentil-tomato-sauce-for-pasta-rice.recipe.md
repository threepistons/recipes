# Lentil and tomato sauce

This is adapted from the Commie Chef column of the [Morning Star](https://morningstaronline.co.uk/), published on the occasion of the 137th [Durham Miners' Gala](https://www.friendsofdurhamminersgala.org/), 8th July 2023.  The ingredients with a % next to them are my addition.  The original writer suggested that this be eaten with with spaghetti, but I found that a portion of brown rice or non-spaghetti pasta works just as well.

Serves four.

### Ingredients

* 1 large onion, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, crushed or grated
* 1 medium carrot, scrubbed and diced
* 110 g green or brown lentils
* 0.5 can chopped tomatoes
* 1 tbsp tomato puree
* 1 tsp paprika, I used smoked paprika.
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 to_taste salt and black pepper
* 1 tsp Marigold swiss bouillon powder, %
* 0.25 tsp cayenne pepper, %
* 250 ml water

### Directions

1. If you are making rice, start it, then wait ten or so minutes.  Refer to the packaging or your rice cooker for portion size.
2. Soften the onion on medium heat in the oil. Don't let it go brown.  A heavy-bottomed pan or stove-friendly casserole dish will make this easier.
3. Add the garlic and fry for another minute, then add the carrot, tomatoes, tomato puree, paprika, cayenne pepper, bouillon, and lentils.
4. Cover with the water and bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer.
5. If you are making pasta, start it now.  Refer to the packaging for portion size and cooking technique.
6. Stir the sauce at intervals for twenty minutes, otherwise the lentils will weld to the bottom of the pan. Add salt and pepper to taste.
