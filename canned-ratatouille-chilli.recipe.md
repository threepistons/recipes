# Canned ratatouille chilli

Currently estimated to provide six portions.

You will need to decide yourself how to cook the 75-100g rice per head that accompanies this chilli. I have a rice cooker that comes with its own measuring scoop and instructions, so I can't help you with hob-cooking rice.

TIP: make a lot of chilli at once for the week, keep it in the fridge, and use a rice cooker to cook only the rice you need fresh every day.

The spice amounts should be adjusted to taste. I started with three tbsp cayenne and regretted it. :fire: :sob:

WARNING: Turning the hob too high or neglecting to stir enough will result in burnt chilli stuck to the bottom of the pan.

### Equipment

* A large hob-safe pot, of at least 3l capacity

### Ingredients

* 450-500 g diced beef, can be frozen
* 1 tin tinned plum tomatoes
* 2 tins tinned ratatouille
* 2 tins tinned mixed beans, or kidney beans. See [Tips and gotchas > tinned beans](tips-gotchas.recipe.md#tinned-beans)
* 1 clove garlic, crushed or diced
* 1 whole onion, diced
* 2 tbsp cayenne powder
* 1 tbsp smoked paprika powder
* 1 count vegetable stock cube/jelly, not made up with water
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil

### Directions

1. Turn the hob on and put the pot on it.
2. In the pot, brown the beef in the oil.
3. Add the garlic and onion to the pot and soften the onion.
4. Add the spices (yes, this early, so you don't get little clumps of spice in the wet ingredients later) and mix them thoroughly with the beef and onion.
5. Add the vegetable stock cube/jelly and the tinned ingredients.
6. Turn the hob down to simmer for, I estimate, about 20-30 minutes with the lid on. Don't forget to stir at intervals.
7. Whilst you are waiting for this chilli to simmer, get on with making the rice.
