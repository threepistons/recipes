# Tips and gotchas

## Cakes

### Butter

Store the butter at room temperature for several hours before starting to prepare the cake. I bent one of my steel-cored silicone spoons trying to work with butter straight from the fridge.

### Verifying that the cake is cooked

A steel skewer inserted into the middle of the cake should come out without any batter adhering to it. Fruit adhering to the skewer is not a cause for concern.

### Lining the cake tin with baking paper

* Smear butter inside the tin to make the lining paper stick.
* Peel the paper off the bottom of the cake whilst turning it out, otherwise you will struggle to get the cake off the paper in one piece when serving it.

## Lemon and lime juices

### Bottled juice in place of "juice of one lemon"

Bottled lemon and lime juices are available at various concentrations, so there is no standard volume of bottled juice that equates to "juice of one lemon/lime". Some bottled lemon and lime juices state on the label how much juice is equivalent to one lemon or lime. My current lemon juice bottle doesn't, but it does tell me how many lemons went into the whole bottle. I divided the volume of the bottle by the lemon count to get the juice volume per lemon. Check before you buy that you will be able to figure out how much juice you need.

### Long-term storage of bottled juice

Once I open my juice, it will degrade within a few weeks. To avoid wasting it, I freeze the juice as ice cubes, with one cube containing half a fruit's equivalant of juice. When I want lemon or lime juice, I let the correct number of cubes melt.

## Tinned beans

My local Lidl have stopped stocking butter beans, kidney beans, and similar single-type tins of beans. Instead, they have tins of mixed beans. Where I used to specify bean types, I now use the mixed beans, but will suggest in each recipe a (possibly untested) substitution for if you can't get mixed beans.
